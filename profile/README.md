# 👋 Frugally

**Shift-left AWS cost control with automated dev shutdowns and budget guardrails.**

Frugally helps engineering teams prevent unexpected cloud spend *before* infrastructure is deployed.

We started as a Slack app that automatically turned off dev resources.
We’re now building a full **shift-left FinOps platform** that embeds cost controls directly into engineering workflows.

## 🚧 The Problem

Most cloud cost tools tell you what you spent **after the fact**.

By then:

* The Terraform has already merged
* The environment is already running
* The budget is already blown

Frugally moves cost control earlier — into pull requests, CI, and daily dev workflows.

## 🛠 What Frugally Does

### 🔌 Automate Dev Environment Shutdowns

Automatically schedule and turn off non-production AWS resources (EC2, RDS, etc.) to prevent idle spend.

### 🛡 Enforce Budget Guardrails in CI

Block or flag infrastructure changes that would exceed defined budgets before they’re deployed.

### 👥 Budgets for Teams & Projects

Assign budgets to Groups, Squads, or individuals and track ownership of cloud spend.

### 🔎 Discover & Assign Existing Resources

Scan AWS accounts or tags, surface high-cost resources, and map them to the right team budgets.

## 🧠 Built for Platform & DevOps Teams

Frugally is designed for:

* Platform Engineering teams
* DevOps teams
* Engineering Managers
* Teams running AWS with Terraform / IaC
* Organisations adopting FinOps practices

If you're trying to:

* Prevent runaway dev costs
* Enforce cloud governance without slowing engineers down
* Make cost visible before deployment

You’re in the right place.

## 📦 Repositories

This organisation contains:

* Example repositories demonstrating cost guardrails
* Infrastructure automation examples
* Integrations and SDKs
* Documentation and usage examples

We aim to make cost control **practical, automatable, and developer-friendly**.
